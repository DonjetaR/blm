## Bayesian linear regresssion

This is a skeleton package you can use as the starting point for building your Bayesian linear regression package. You should *fork* the repository to make your own version and then later use *pull requests* to hand in your project exercises and the final package.

The rest of this README file contains documentation for using this repository as a package template and for how you should hand in exercises. You shouldn't keep this text -- you can always find it again in the original repository -- but once you have read it you should update it and use this file for the documentation of your own package.

### Forking a repository

### Making pull requests

### Continuous integration (CI)
